Ada OpenGL Framework

Provides a few basic GUI components and an easy way to create an OpenGL window.
Please look at the examples in /examples.

Requirements on Debian:

 Required : libx11dev (xlib.h)
            libgl1-mesa-dev (GL.so)
            gnat-4.6 or higher
            gprbuild

Compilation:

 Run the make file in the root folder. It will select a default configuration,
 which you can change by running buildcfg\configprog.
 This may be a dependency on freetype or mpich2.

Examples:

 All examples require the compilation step described above.
 Each example has a .gpr file. Run:
 
  gprbuild example.gpr
